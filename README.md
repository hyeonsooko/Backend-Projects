# Backend Development Projects - README

Welcome to my backend development projects repository! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a collection of my backend development projects, inspired by the comprehensive [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) backend roadmap. Each project is designed to enhance my understanding of backend technologies, strengthen my coding skills, and showcase practical implementations of concepts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my journey through backend development, starting from foundational concepts to advanced topics. By following the roadmap, I aim to:

- Build a strong understanding of backend development.
- Explore modern tools, frameworks, and best practices.
- Create real-world projects that demonstrate my skills.

## Projects Overview

Below is a categorized list of projects, which will be updated as I progress through the roadmap:

### 1. **Fundamentals**
- HTTP and REST API Basics
- CRUD Operations
- Authentication and Authorization
- Database Integration (SQL/NoSQL)

### 2. **Intermediate Concepts**
- Middleware Implementation
- Caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- Background Jobs and Queues
- API Rate Limiting

### 3. **Advanced Topics**
- Microservices Architecture
- GraphQL APIs
- Real-time Applications with WebSockets
- CI/CD Pipelines

### 4. **Cloud and DevOps**
- Dockerized Applications
- Deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure
- Logging and Monitoring
- Load Balancing and Scaling
